I am a May 2024 ML Masters' grad at the University of Michigan, currently looking for full-time opportunities. 
* Currently, I am harnessing the ability of LLMs at extracting data for speeding up meta-analysis, identifying and working around their common failures and determining if they are suitable for scaling up.
* I am a co-author on a research article submitted to an upcoming top HCI conference.
* I am driven by an unending desire to make sense of the world in and around me, particularly with the mathematics behind ML and the creativity of software engineering as a means.
* I also pen my interpretation of the world and the various feelings it elicits, head over to my `_pages/blog.md` to explore my latest works!
